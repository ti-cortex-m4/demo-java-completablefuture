CompletableFuture - A Future that may be explicitly completed (setting its value and status), and may be used as a CompletionStage, supporting dependent functions and actions that trigger upon its completion.


>The Java CompletableFuture API is designed to implement multi-stage operations that have a single result.
If it’s necessary to implement multi-stage operations that have a stream of results, it’s necessary to use
reactive streams implemented in Java Flow API or third-party frameworks (RxJava, etc).



Synchronous vs. asynchronous API
The phrase synchronous API is another way of talking about a traditional call to a method: you call it,
the caller waits while the method computes, the method returns, and the caller continues with the returned value.
Even if the caller and callee were executed on different threads, the caller would still wait for the callee
to complete. This situation gives rise to the phrase blocking call.
By contrast, in an asynchronous API the method returns immediately (or at least before its computation is complete),
delegating its remaining computation to a thread, which runs asynchronously to the caller—hence,
the phrase nonblocking call. The remaining computation gives its value to the caller by calling a callback method,
or the caller invokes a further “wait until the computation is complete” method.
This style of computation is common in I/O systems programming: you initiate a disc access,
which happens asynchronously while you do more computation, and when you have nothing more useful to do,
you wait until the disc blocks are loaded into memory. Note that blocking and nonblocking are often used for
specific implementations of I/O by the operating system. However, these terms tend to be used interchangeably
with asynchronous and synchronous even in non-I/O contexts.  Executing relatively long-lasting operations
by using asynchronous tasks can increase the performance and responsiveness of your application, especially
if it relies on one or more remote external services.

Futures in Java 8 - II
56
 CompletableFuture – a Future that may be explicitly
completed (by setting its value and status), and may
be used as a CompletionStage, supporting dependent
functions and actions that trigger upon its completion.
 CompletionStage – a stage of possibly asynchronous
computation, that is triggered by completion of
previous stage or stages (CompletionStages form
Direct Acyclic Graph – DAG). A stage performs an
action or computes value and completes upon
termination of its computation, which in turn triggers
next dependent stages. Computation may be Function
(apply), Consumer (accept), or Runnable (run).

CompletionStage
60
 Computation may be Function (apply), Consumer
(accept), or Runnable (run) – e.g.:
completionStage.thenApply( x -> x * x )
.thenAccept(System.out::print )
.thenRun( System.out::println )
 Stage computation can be triggered by completion of
1 (then), 2 (combine), or either 1 of 2 (either)
 Functional composition can be applied to stages
themselves instead to their results using compose
 handle & whenComplete – support unconditional
computation – both normal or exceptional triggering
